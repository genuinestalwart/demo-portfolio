                <p>You might saw me fighting Dormammu, Thanos, and casting spells for Spiderman. But when Wong found it out, he removed me from my position and told me to learn his (Spiderman's) web development as a punishment. 😤</p>

                <h3>To become the next Web Dev Supreme</h3>
                <p>I already learned HTML and CSS. Now I am learning javascript and will not stop until he let me become the Sorcerer Supreme again. People learn html to hack NASA. But I am the only one who is learning it to trap Wong in magical tags for revenge. 🤫</p>
